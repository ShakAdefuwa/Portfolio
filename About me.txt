From London, I studied Chemistry at the University of Reading. I started my professional career as a teaching assistant in South London and subsequently as a science teacher in the United Arab Emirates.
It was during this time as a science teacher in Abu Dhabi that my interest in data analysis sparked. One of my key responsibilities involved tracking student assessment data in Excel, and it was there I discovered the power of data visualisation. I quickly found that these visuals drastically simplified parent-teacher interactions, enabling me to share and present crucial information even across a language barrier. This experience offered a compelling, practical example of how data can be an effective tool in communication and a vital aid in solving real-world problems.
Driven by my continued desire to grow, I enrolled in a Data Technician Bootcamp, learning a wide range of essential data analysis tools, including Power BI, SQL, and Python. I'm now actively creating projects to showcase these skills and am committed to continuously expanding my toolkit, with my current focus on learning about Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Data Build Tool (DBT).
