Business Context & Objectives

I decided to refurbish this dashboard to not only clean it up and make it look more professional, but to also think about it more from a business perspective.
This led me to a much less cluttered dashboard that still retained key performance metrics but now with sharper focus on the more meaningful areas of the dataset. 

Project Overview & Process

Imported data with Python, checked for duplicate and empty cells, corrected formatting issues

Imported data into Power BI

Produced a rough version of the dashboard, using essentially random visuals

At a later date, refurbished it with relevant visuals while improved the general aesthetic


Reflections & Learnings

The initial experience of creating this dashboard was an attempt at experimenting with a random dataset and seeing what visuals I could produce. I ended up with a mess of a dashboard, filled with meaningless or boring visuals that told no story.

 
After working with Ben's Pizza, I had a much clearer idea of what the purpose of a dashboard is. It was no longer about the sheer mass of information, but more about presenting data in a way that's actually useful.
