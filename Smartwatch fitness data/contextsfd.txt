The cleaning and visualisation of a small dataset through Python's library - Pandas

The below data set shows the workout information collected by an individual's watch over the course of a month.

On the Left is the raw data
On the Right in the cleaned data


Since the dataset is relatively small, I aimed to minimise data loss by avoiding unnecessary deletions. Instead, I used mean imputation to handle missing values.

Initially, I filled gaps in the Calories Burned column using the overall mean.
(see inserting-initial-mean.png)

However, this approach skewed the data. For example, a 45-minute workout would appear to burn significantly more calories than similar entries. To address this, I calculated two separate means based on workout duration, allowing for a more context-aware imputation. 

 
The mean of Duration 45 entries for missing 45 values  -  285 Calories
The mean of Duration 60 entries for missing 60 values -  314 Calories

Currently the two missing values were set to 305. I do not wish to include them into my mean calculations, hence why they're excluded. I double checked to ensure no real values were excluded.

Again, since the dataset is small, I seek to minimise deletion of data. 


Can we generate a visual from this Data?

This code generates the following plot:

This plot suggests a drop in intensity over the 30 days. Even though this dataset wasn't ideal for showcasing matplotlib's full potential, it still offered a useful experience. I thought a simpler cleaner plot would be appropriate here.
